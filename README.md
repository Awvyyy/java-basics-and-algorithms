## 📘 About This Repository

This repository contains my personal collection of **Java learning exercises**.  
Every file is a **small, focused program** that demonstrates one key concept:

- loops  
- conditions  
- working with numbers  
- algorithm design  
- clean coding practices  

The goal is to build a strong foundation and gradually move toward more advanced Java development.

## 💡 Included Tasks (with explanations)

### 🔹 **Palindrome**
Checks if a number reads the same forward and backward.

### 🔹 **DigitSum**
Extracts digits using `% 10` and finds their total.

### 🔹 **EvenOddDigits**
Counts even vs. odd digits using modular arithmetic.

### 🔹 **MaxMinAverage**
Processes N numbers and finds:
- maximum  
- minimum  
- average  

### 🔹 **PositiveNegativeZero**
Classifies input numbers into 3 categories.

### 🔹 **FizzBuzz**
Classic programming challenge using modular conditions.

### 🔹 **Print1toN**
Outputs numbers using a simple `for` loop.

### 🔹 **EvenNumbers**
Prints all even numbers from 1 to N.

### 🔹 **Factorial**
Computes `n!` using iterative multiplication.

## 🛣 Roadmap

Planned future additions:

- ⏳ Array algorithms  
- ⏳ Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)  
- ⏳ Searching (Linear, Binary)  
- ⏳ String manipulation algorithms  
- ⏳ Recursion basics  
- ⏳ OOP: Classes, Objects, Methods  
- ⏳ Mini-projects (Calculator, Guess-the-Number Game, etc.)
