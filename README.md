# 📘 Java Basics & Algorithms

This repository contains my learning projects and algorithmic exercises written in Java.
Each file represents a separate mini-program that practices core Java concepts:

input/output
conditions (if / else if / else)
loops (for, while)
working with digits
number processing
basic algorithms
clean code structure

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in Java through solving practical tasks.

📂 Project Structure
src/
 ├── Palindrome.java
 ├── DigitSum.java
 ├── EvenOddDigits.java
 ├── MaxMinAverage.java
 ├── PositiveNegativeZero.java
 ├── FizzBuzz.java
 ├── Print1toN.java
 ├── EvenNumbers.java
 └── Factorial.java

Each Java file includes a complete solution that can be compiled and executed independently.


📌 Included Tasks
🔹 Palindrome
Checks whether a number reads the same forwards and backwards.

🔹 DigitSum
Calculates the sum of all digits in a number.

🔹 EvenOddDigits
Counts how many digits inside a number are even or odd.

🔹 MaxMinAverage
Reads N numbers and finds their maximum, minimum, and average.

🔹 PositiveNegativeZero
Counts how many of the entered numbers are positive, negative, or zero.

🔹 FizzBuzz
Classic programming task: prints “Fizz”, “Buzz” or “FizzBuzz” depending on divisibility.

🔹 Print1toN
Prints all numbers from 1 to N using a loop.

🔹 EvenNumbers
Prints all even numbers from 1 to N.

🔹 Factorial
Computes the factorial of a number using iterative multiplication.

🧠 Purpose of This Repository
This repository documents my progress while learning Java.
It demonstrates understanding of:

basic syntax
algorithmic thinking
number manipulation
loop control
modular task-solving
writing clean, readable code
The exercises here form the foundation for more advanced Java topics such as arrays, functions, classes, and object-oriented programming.

▶️ How to Run
Compile and run any file using:

javac FileName.java
java FileName

Example:

javac Palindrome.java
java Palindrome


🚀 Next Steps
In future updates, the repository may include:
array-based algorithms
sorting
searching
recursion
object-oriented programming exercises
project-style mini-apps
