# This repository contains my learning projects in Java.


Here I practice:

basic syntax
conditions (if, else if, else)
loops (for, while)
working with numbers
simple algorithms
Each file is a separate mini-task I solved while learning Java.

✔ Included tasks:

Palindrome check
Sum of digits
Counting even and odd digits
Finding the maximum, minimum and average
Classifying numbers: positive, negative, zero
FizzBuzz
Print numbers from 1 to N
Print even numbers
Factorial calculation

💡 Goal

To build strong foundation in Java and demonstrate my progress through clear, readable solutions.
